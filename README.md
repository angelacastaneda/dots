# ...D.O.T.S...

My dotfiles, scripts, and weird hacks to get a system usable for me. ~ is a git
repository (see inspiration for setup
[here](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html)), and has some highlights:

* running a terminal based setup with vim, tmux, aerc, etc
* using pass or something aliased to it to handle passwords
* using zsh with some plugins
* other configs like emacs as submodules

## todo:

- [ ] make custom nvim conf
- [ ] make auto install script for packages in alpine
- [ ] turn more aliases into scripts
- [ ] make more shell ambiguous 
- [ ] use git-annex for secrets too big for pass

## license

I stole enough scripts from [voidrice](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice)
and made enough depending on [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org), that I just
wanna [GPL](./LICENSES/gpl-3.0) everything here to feel safe.
